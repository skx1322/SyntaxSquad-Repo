# INTRODUCTION
A codenection project teamed with Sin Kai Xing, Venggadanaathan A/L K.Salvam Rishikumaran and Julian Koh;

# Track 1 Student Lifestyle 
We decided to go for track 1 student lifestyle and decided our project to be about tutor app for student.

# Problem Statement
As someone from IT, I think it is best that we should learn thing outside of syallabus from our own as it can teaches you new hard skills that can keep you ahead on everyone. Hence, we wanted to create this project with objective to develop a tutor web app that allow student to attend both pre-recorded or real-time tutor's session from various courses. 

Our objective for this app is to promote affordable and personalized courses for student from secondary school, college or university whether it is to learn new skill or to keep up with subject within their syallabus. We also hope to attract people who desired to become tutor to be part of the tutors team as they can tried to gain some experience and learn to improve from students feedback from the course they created.

To ensure students are confident in their tutors, our system will tried to promote tutor that have received great feedback from their previous student and if that's not enough, we also ensure that tutor kept their portfolio transparent to the other students to gain their trust.

### Localhost Development Setup
## Local Running Frontend
# 1: Main Runtime
- You are required to install NodeJS in order to run the frontend code. Make sure you install the latest one.

https://nodejs.org/en/download
```

# 2. Cloning
